# Bitcoin Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the future price movements of Bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency, using machine learning techniques. Predicting cryptocurrency prices is a challenging task due to the high volatility and non-linear nature of the market. However, by leveraging historical price data and various features, we can build models to forecast future price trends with reasonable accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical Bitcoin price data. It includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, and more. The data spans over a period of time, typically ranging from several months to several years, depending on the available data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain historical Bitcoin price data from reliable sources such as cryptocurrency exchanges or financial data providers.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistency in data format. Feature engineering may also be performed to create additional relevant features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the underlying patterns and trends. Visualizations such as time series plots, distribution plots, and correlation matrices can be used for exploratory analysis.

4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting Bitcoin prices. Common models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM) and XGBoost.

5. **Model Training**: Split the dataset into training and Validing sets. Train the selected models using the training data, tuning hyperparameters as necessary to optimize performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed for robust evaluation.

7. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to make predictions on unseen data (future price data). Monitor model performance and adjust as necessary to improve accuracy and reliability.

## Implementation

This project is implemented using Python programming language and popular libraries such as  numpy, matplotlib, pandas and scikit-learn for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation. The code is organized into modular components for ease of understanding and reproducibility.

## Conclusion

We can observe that the accuracy achieved by the state-of-the-art ML model is no better than simply guessing with a probability of ~75%. Possible reasons for this may be the lack of data or using a very simple model to perform such a complex task as Stock Market prediction.
